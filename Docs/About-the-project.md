# The project

**“diktat. Les dessous de la beauté”** is an interactive augmented reality art exhibition. It deals with beauty standards that society has established and tends to denounce the negative aspects that can drift from it. Presented as a touring exhibition, it is made of a collection of posters representing for each of them a beauty diktat that is depicted through different everyday life situations.  

Visitors can use tactile tablets available for them or download the app on their own devices as well as going to visit the exhibition so they can find out what's hiding behind those daily life portraits. By scanning an illustration with the app, the poster will turn into something different, some parts will detach and others will appear. These transformations will change the whole scene which becomes appalling and provocative so it can denounce the diktat being questioned. 

Examining an augmented reality poster will enable the visitors to interact in order to make new parts appear and learn more about them. For each diktat, it is possible to access an explanatory text/comment about its origin, whereabout in the world it is most present, the individual it affects and other links from different resources.

The main goal of the project is to help visitors to realize that beauty diktats are everywhere and there are not only the ones we expect. We also want them to learn all the background behind each topic. The exhibition approach is used to bring an artistic side and to have a whole collection of different life situations in order to attract more people.
